          <p>
            Practo takes issues relating to data confidentiality, disclosure, security, and protection very seriously. Seeking permission from patients, doctors, and establishments before collecting or using any information enables Practo users to have full control over data:
          </p>
          <h4>For consumers:</h4>
       <p>As per our privacy policy, we ask for permission before sending any messages or promotional content. Consumers can also change their communication preferences any time they want</p>
        
        <h4>For establishments:</h4>
        <p>Only doctors—and NOT Practo—can trigger a communication with their walk-in patients. In line with our privacy policy, doctors also need to seek permission from their patients before sending out any Practo-related communication</p>

          <h1> Help consumers find and connect</h1>
          <h1>with the most suitable doctor</h1>
          <p>
            Patients using Practo are connected to medical establishments with the help of a fully automated and an unbiased algorithm:
          </p>
          <p>The algorithm is governed by four key principles: patient’s proximity to establishment, availability of the doctor, suitability, and match with other patients' stories</p>
        <p>Although this algorithm is the same for both categories of establishments at Practo, Prime and Basic, it delivers different output based on the patient's specific requirements—including instant booking, assured appointment, and shorter wait time (features available for Prime establishments)</p>

          <p>
            Practo maintains a whitebook, which is a set of degrees and qualifications to help with specialization mapping. This is in line with government and medical council guidelines:
          </p>

          <p>Since it’s open-sourced, doctors are free to add new qualifications for different specialities. This, in turn, is reviewed and verified by our panel of experts that includes senior doctors and academicians</p>
        
        <p>A doctor can also suggest changes to an existing qualification, which is then reviewed by the panel before being published
